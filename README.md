# JustAi

**Autonomous orchestration, adaptive memory, and trajectory intelligence for AI coding agents.**

JustAi is a multi-agent orchestration system that decomposes high-level engineering goals into task plans, delegates execution across heterogeneous model backends, reviews output against acceptance criteria, and improves over time through trajectory-based learning. It integrates enterprise-grade observability (LangFuse), real-time coordination (SpacetimeDB), and persistent vector memory (HNSW) into a unified pipeline that treats every agent run as training data for the next.

Built on the [rUv agentic framework](https://github.com/ruvnet) — an open-source ecosystem for multi-agent swarm orchestration, self-adaptive feedback loops, and autonomous workflow coordination.

A goal enters the system. The **Intent Gate** classifies it (execution, multi-step, research, or ambiguous). The **Planner** decomposes it into mini-sized tasks, enriched with similar past trajectories retrieved via HNSW approximate nearest-neighbor search (similarity threshold ≥ 0.6). The **Reviewer** validates plan quality before execution — a pre-flight gate that catches ambiguous descriptions, missing success criteria, and incorrect dependency ordering. The **Checkpoint** enforces risk-level approval (R0 auto-approve through R3 manual-only). The **Delegator** posts tasks to SpacetimeDB, where agents claim and execute them. The **Synthesizer** aggregates results, stores the run in persistent memory, and records the trajectory for future learning.

If a task fails, the **Escalation Engine** re-routes it to a stronger model automatically. Failure reasons are persisted in memory so future routing decisions can avoid known-bad assignments.

## Key Capabilities

### Multi-Model Orchestration

Real-time visibility into the full orchestration pipeline — from intent classification through agent execution to review. Mission Control displays active runs, per-model cost, stage latency, and the 6-stage pipeline state at a glance.

![Mission Control](screenshots/mission-control.png)

### Adaptive Task Routing & Escalation

Every task starts with the cheapest capable model. When mini-swe-agent (74% SWE-bench Verified — the highest-performing open-source coding agent) cannot complete a task, JustAi automatically escalates to claude-opus for deeper reasoning. The Task Board provides a 5-column Kanban view (pending → claimed → in_progress → done → archived) with per-task metadata: attempt number, retry count, duration, and execution result.

![Task Board](screenshots/task-board.png)

### Trajectory Intelligence & Cross-Project Learning

Every agent run produces a structured trajectory — a step-by-step record of actions taken, tools invoked, files modified, and outcomes observed. JustAi's trajectory system operates in three modes:

- **Post-mortem analysis** — AI-powered root cause identification. Each trajectory (up to 40 steps, condensed to 150-char summaries) is sent to an LLM for structured analysis: summary, root cause, divergence step, recommendation, and file-change manifest.
- **Pattern extraction** — Aggregate statistics across trajectories: success rate, average step count, average cost, common failure reasons keyed by action type and command prefix, and efficiency trends over time.
- **Context enrichment** — Before planning new tasks, the system searches the trajectory store for semantically similar past runs (HNSW vector search, cosine similarity ≥ 0.6). Matched trajectories are formatted as structured context injected into the planner prompt, allowing the system to learn from both successes and failures.

This implements a form of **experience replay** — a technique from reinforcement learning where past experiences are stored and selectively re-used to accelerate learning. Unlike traditional RL, JustAi uses semantic similarity rather than random sampling, ensuring the most relevant experiences inform each new planning cycle.

![Trajectory Analysis](screenshots/trajectory-postmortem.png)

**How trajectories compound over time:** Each completed run adds to the trajectory store. As the corpus grows, the planner receives increasingly relevant context for new goals — patterns that worked, failure modes to avoid, and efficient step sequences for similar tasks. This creates a positive feedback loop: more runs → richer trajectory corpus → better plans → higher success rates → more valuable trajectories. Across projects sharing the same memory backend, trajectories from one codebase inform planning in another, enabling genuine cross-project transfer learning.

### Enterprise Observability via LangFuse

JustAi integrates [LangFuse](https://langfuse.com) — the open-source LLM observability platform — at every stage of the orchestrator pipeline. This is not surface-level logging; each pipeline stage (intent gate, planner, reviewer, executor, delegator, synthesizer) wraps its LLM calls in a `trace_generation()` context manager that captures:

| Metric | Granularity | Method |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **Cost** | Per-call, per-stage, per-model, daily aggregates, running totals | Stacked bar charts with model breakdown |
| **Latency** | p50 / p90 / p99 percentiles, per-stage breakdown, bottleneck identification | Time-series with percentile bands |
| **Token usage** | Input/output counts per trace, daily aggregates | Cumulative tracking |
| **Quality** | Success/failure rates, first-try vs. retry tracking, failure category histograms | Cost-vs-quality scatter plots |
| **AI insights** | Heuristic analysis of first-try rates, failure patterns, cost-quality correlation | Auto-generated narrative |

When LangFuse keys are configured (`LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`), every orchestrator invocation emits full traces. When keys are absent, all tracing functions are no-ops — zero overhead, no code changes required. The `get_aggregated_metrics()` function computes 7-day rolling windows across up to 500 recent traces, producing the data structures that drive the Observability dashboard.

This level of per-stage, per-model instrumentation is typically found in enterprise MLOps platforms. JustAi brings it to autonomous coding agents — making cost optimization, latency profiling, and quality regression detection first-class concerns rather than afterthoughts.

### SpacetimeDB: Real-Time Coordination with Full Audit Trail

JustAi uses [SpacetimeDB](https://spacetimedb.com) as its coordination backbone — a relational database with built-in WebSocket subscriptions that combines the consistency guarantees of SQL with the reactivity of a real-time event bus.

**Why SpacetimeDB instead of A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocols:**

Traditional A2A communication (direct agent-to-agent messaging) is fire-and-forget: once a message is sent, there is no durable record, no queryable state, and no way to recover coordination state after a crash. SpacetimeDB inverts this model. Every task state transition (pending → claimed → in_progress → done) is a database write with a timestamp. The coordination layer *is* the audit trail. This means:

- **Persistence is free** — every task claim, heartbeat, and status change is already stored in a relational schema. There is no separate logging step.
- **Recovery is trivial** — after a crash, agents reconnect and query current state. There is no message replay, no consensus protocol, no reconciliation phase.
- **Observability is built-in** — the dashboard queries the same tables agents write to. Real-time visibility requires zero additional infrastructure.
- **Consistency over speed is the right trade-off** — for autonomous coding agents where a single task may run for 30 minutes, the coordination overhead of a database write (sub-millisecond for SpacetimeDB's in-process SQLite) is negligible compared to task execution time.

The SpacetimeDB client (`spacetime.ts`) implements dual-transport connectivity:
- **Primary:** WebSocket subscription for real-time `TransactionUpdate` push notifications
- **Fallback:** HTTP polling via SQL queries (3-second intervals) with exponential backoff reconnection (1s → 2s → 4s → 8s → 16s → 30s max)

Agent liveness is monitored via heartbeat timestamps with a 90-second staleness threshold. The dashboard renders transport status (WebSocket / polling / disconnected) in the sidebar so operators always know the data freshness.

### Persistent Memory with Vector Search

Cross-session memory backed by a hybrid storage engine: sql.js for structured data and HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs) for 384-dimensional vector similarity search. The Memory Bridge communicates via JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP to the [claude-flow](https://github.com/ruvnet/ruflo) MCP server — a direct HTTP path that benchmarks at ~5ms per operation, 40x faster than the CLI subprocess fallback (~200ms+).

Memory is organized by namespace (`justai` for general entries, `justai-trajectories` for trajectory outcomes) and supports:
- **Exact key retrieval** — O(1) lookup for known entries
- **Semantic search** — HNSW approximate nearest-neighbor queries over auto-generated embeddings
- **Cross-session persistence** — session context stored at pipeline start, restored at next invocation
- **Run history** — every completed run stored with structured metadata (goal, intent, task count, success/failure counts, duration)

### Agent Registry & Swarm Coordination

Live visibility into the agent pool. The registry combines SpacetimeDB agent table data with claude-flow MCP swarm status, showing agent roles, online/offline/stale status, current task assignments, and swarm topology (mesh, hierarchical, ring, or star configurations).

### Escalation Strategy

1. Every task starts with mini-swe-agent (cheapest, fastest)
2. On failure, the task is automatically escalated to claude-opus
3. The failure reason is recorded in memory for future routing optimization
4. The swarm delegator (`swarm_delegator.py`) supports parallel dispatch for scale testing
